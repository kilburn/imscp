## i-MSCP installation on Debian

### 1) Requirements

- 1 GHz or faster 32 bits (x86) or 64 bits (x64) processor
- 1 Gio memory (minimum) - For heavily loaded servers or high flow is recommended at least 8 Gio
- 1 Gio of available hard disk space for i-MSCP and managed services, excluding user data
- Internet access (at least 100 Mbits/s recommended)
- A Linux kernel >= 2.6.26
- A file system supporting extended attributes such as ext2, ext3, ext4 and reiserfs*
- Appropriate privileges to create devices (Linux: the CAP_CAP_MKNOD capability)
- Appropriate privileges to mount, unmount and remount filesystems (Linux: the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability)

#### Reiserfs users

In order, to use the reiserfs file system with i-MSCP, you must follow these steps:

Edit your `/etc/fstab` file to add the `attrs` option for your device (e.g. device containing the /var partition). For
instance:

```
UUID=74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd /     reiserfs notail          0    1
```

should be updated to:

```
UUID=74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd /     reiserfs notail,attrs    0    1
```

Once you did that, you can remount your device. For instance:

```
# mount -o remount /dev/disk/by-uuid/74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd
```

*Note:* If needed, you can find the uuid of your device, with the following command:

```
# blkid <device>
```

where `<device>` must be replaced by your device path such as `/dev/sda1`

#### LXC containers

If you want install i-MSCP inside a LXC container, the following conditions have to be met:

- You must have the `CAP_MKNOD` capability inside the container. Thus, you must ensure that `mknod` is not in the list
  of dropped capabilities
- You must have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability inside the container (required to mount filesystems). Thus, you must
ensure that `sys_admin` is not in the list of dropped capabilities.
- You must allow the creation of devices inside the container by white-listing them. Easy solution is to add
  `lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = a *:* rwm` in LXC container configuration file.
- If you use `Apparmor`, you must allow mount,umount and remount operations inside your container by modifying the
  default apparmor profile `/etc/apparmor.d/lxc/lxc-default` or by creating a specific apparmor profile for the
  container.

Note that these operations must be done on the host, not in the container.

#### OpenVZ containers (Proxmox and Virtuozzo)

You could have to increase the `fs.ve-mount-nr` limit, else, an error such as `mount: Cannot allocate memory` could be
threw by CageFS. To avoid this problem you must:

- Increase the limit by adding an entry such as `fs.ve-mount-nr = 4096` to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file
- Make the new limit effective by executing the `sysctl -p` command

Note that these operations must be done on the host, not in the container.

#### Supported Debian versions

Any released version >= 7.x (Debian 8.x recommended)

### 2) i-MSCP Installation

#### 1. Make sure that your system is up-to-date

    # apt-get update
    # apt-get dist-upgrade

#### 2. Install the pre-required packages

    # apt-get install ca-certificates perl wget whiptail

#### 3. Download and untar the distribution files

    # cd /usr/local/src
    # wget https://github.com/i-MSCP/imscp/archive/1.3.16.tar.gz
    # tar -xzf 1.3.16.tar.gz

#### 4. Change to the newly created directory

    # cd imscp-1.3.16

#### 5. Install i-MSCP by running its installer

    # perl imscp-autoinstall -d

### 3) i-MSCP Upgrade

#### 1. Make sure to have a backup of your current data

Before any upgrade attempt it is highly recommended to perform a backup of the following directories

    /var/www/virtual
    /var/mail/virtual

Those directories hold the data of your customers and it is really important to backup them for an easy recovering in
case something goes wrong during upgrade.

#### 2. Make sure that your system is up-to-date

    # apt-get update
    # apt-get dist-upgrade

#### 3. Download and untar the distribution files

    # cd /usr/local/src
    # wget https://github.com/i-MSCP/imscp/archive/1.3.16.tar.gz
    # tar -xzf 1.3.16.tar.gz

#### 4. Change to the newly created directory

    # cd imscp-1.3.16

#### 5. Update i-MSCP by running its installer

    # perl imscp-autoinstall -d
